# 🤖 Bargain Bot: E-commerce Price Comparison Tool

Bargain Bot is a simple, yet effective Flask web application that scrapes product prices from major Indian e-commerce sites (Amazon India and Snapdeal) and compares them to find the lowest price for the user.

## 🚀 Features

  * **Price Comparison:** Compares product prices between Amazon and Snapdeal.
  * **Lowest Price Identification:** Clearly displays the lowest price found and the source.
  * **Direct Links:** Provides direct links to the product pages for immediate purchase.
  * **Accessory Filtering:** Includes logic to filter out unwanted accessories (like cases, covers, etc.) to focus on the main product.
  * **Simple Web Interface:** Easy-to-use search and results pages built with Flask and Jinja2 templating.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components: the main Flask application, the web scraping logic, and the user interface (HTML/CSS).

```

└── static/

```

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1\. Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** installed on your system.

### 2\. Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

  * `Flask`: For the web application framework.
  * `requests`: To make HTTP requests for web scraping.
  * `BeautifulSoup4` (`bs4`): To parse the HTML content.

You can install all dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4
```

### 3\. Running the Application

1.  Make sure your project files are structured as shown in the **Project Structure** section.

2.  Open your terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the project (`bargain-bot/`).

3.  Run the main application file:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  The application will start, and you can access it in your web browser at the address provided in the terminal, usually:
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## 📝 Code Breakdown

### `app.py`

This is the main entry point for the Flask application.

1.  **Imports:** Imports Flask and the scraping functions from `scrapper.py`.
2.  **Route (`/`):** Handles both `GET` (display initial search page `index.html`) and `POST` (process search query and display results `results.html`).
3.  **POST Logic:**
      * Retrieves `product_name` from the form.
      * Calls `snapdeal()` and `amazon()` functions to get data.
      * Calls `convert()` to transform the raw price string (e.g., "₹1,23,456") into an integer.
      * Compares the integer prices to determine the absolute minimum price, source, and URL.
      * Renders `results.html` with all the data.

### `scrapper.py`

This file contains the logic for making requests, parsing HTML, and cleaning data.

  * **`headers`:** A `User-Agent` header is used to mimic a real browser, which helps prevent blocks from the websites.
  * **`EXCLUDE_KEYWORDS`:** A list of keywords (e.g., "COVER", "CASE") used to filter out accessories from search results.
  * **`convert(a)`:** A utility function using Python's `re` module to remove all non-digit/non-dot characters from a price string (like currency symbols and commas) and safely convert it to an integer.
  * **`snapdeal(name)` / `amazon(name)`:**
      * Constructs the search URL.
      * Sends an HTTP GET request and parses the HTML with BeautifulSoup.
      * **Iterates** through search result containers.
      * **Filtering Logic:** Implements a matching system:
          * It checks if the search `name` is in the product title.
          * It uses `strict_mode` (based on whether the search term itself contains accessory keywords) to decide whether to exclude products that are accessories. This helps ensure that a search for "iPhone 13" doesn't return an "iPhone 13 Case."
      * Returns a dictionary with the raw `price` and the product `url`.

### 📄 HTML Templates (`index.html` & `results.html`)

The templates use **Jinja2** to dynamically render content.

  * **`index.html`:** Contains a simple form to submit the product name.
  * **`results.html`:**
      * Displays the product name.
      * Highlights the **best price** in a prominent green box.
      * Iterates through the `results` dictionary to show a card for every source found, including the display price and a direct "Visit Site" link.
      * Displays an "No exact matches found" message if `min_price` is 0.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Web scraping is dependent on the target website's structure. Changes to the HTML of Amazon or Snapdeal (class names, element hierarchy) will likely break the scraping logic in `scrapper.py`. This project is for educational purposes and personal use. Always respect the terms of service of the websites you are scraping.
